description: Seraclean is an ice maker maintenance & quality-control company that needed a way to automate its procedures. What I built was a way to hasten technical reports & automate the creation of certifications and the sending of reports to the associated clients. The partner saw a decrease in overall procedure times by 35-40% after the mini CMS was created.

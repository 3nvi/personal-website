description: Edutailors is an online e-learning platform aimed at bridging the gap between teachers & students across Greece. A student can purchase courses, receive material in the form of documents, watch pre-recorded videos, undertake tests to progress into next chapters & finally attend online classes with live chat. A student can also schedule 1-to-1 sessions with instructors by booking them into their calendar. All that is in-platform.

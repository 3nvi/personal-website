description: Teletrady is an mobile-first web platform that acts as a marketplace for carrier data. You can sell any excess data, sms & minutes that you have from your carrier or buy some if you are in need. Your purchases will be instantly delivered to your phone, while your successfull sells will translate in direct funds to your bank or paypal account. The project was eventually dropped after running for a few months due to stakeholder limitations.

description: I recently had to implement a multi-language static website, so I thought Gatsby would be a fun choice; surely people have a lot of guides out there on how to do it. Turns out, implementing it the naive way is easy, but if you want to minify manual work and streamline translations through automated processes, things can get hard. In this article, I’ll be attempting to showcase the problems that I’ve faced, the solutions that I ended up using and the benefits of each approach.

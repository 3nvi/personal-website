description: In this article I’ll attempt to share a few tips & optimization tricks that you should consider when aiming to minimize the footprint of your React app. I’m confident that after reading this article you will be able to reduce your bundle size by at least 5–10%, since I’ll start with conventional tips and move on to edge-case micro-optimizations. I also want to point out that most of the things that I’ll go through are not React specific, but apply to all JS apps that are built using Webpack.

description: In an app that I’ve recently worked on, I had to interact with 2 different APIs; a typical JSON-based API from a django project, as well as a “real-time API” which was coming directly from Firebase. What I wanted is to have a unified way of querying & storing my data, without having to differentiate my approach based on where the data comes from. In this article we’ll implement just that.

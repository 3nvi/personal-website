# About <br /> me

I was born in Athens in 1991 - (pause for a bit to do the math) -, where I attended the National Technical University of Athens as an
Electrical & Computer engineer. I always wanted to become a pilot, but some things don't work out the way you want them to.

I officially started working as a software engineer after my thesis got featured on a
core EU Union project. For the past 8 years, I have been working as a Web Engineer with an
emphasis on Front-end & Performance. Although I won't brand myself as a fullstack developer, I have worked multiple years with
back-end technologies like Rails, Django, Memcached, Docker, Redis and
Elasticsearch and I keep creating services with these technologies for my freelancing projects. I'm also
proficient in most web-related & infrastructure AWS Services such as S3, Cloudfront, ECS, ECR, Cloudformation, Lambda, API Gateway, etc.
Lately, I have been working primarily as a Front-end developer and have successfully architected & deployed large scale applications,
turning any mistakes or successes into articles. Most recently, I've been focusing
on consulting around all things React, Redux, GraphQL & Web Performance.

I love F1, cycling, hiking, DnD & World of Warcraft and sometimes it's all I can talk about.

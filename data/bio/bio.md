# About <br /> me

I was born in Athens in 1991 - (pause for a bit to do the math) -, where I attended the National Technical University of Athens as an
Electrical & Computer engineer. I always wanted to become a pilot, but some things don't work out the way you want them to.

My career as a software engineer officially started after my thesis got featured on a
core EU project and for the past 5 years I have been working with Javascript &
Python. Although I won't brand myself as a fullstack developer, I have worked over 2 years with
back-end & infrastructure technologies like Rails, Django, Memcached, Docker, Redis and
Elasticsearch and I keep creating services in Express, Django & Flask for freelancing projects.
Since 2016, I have been working solely as a Front-end developer almost exclusively using
React & Svelte. I have successfully architected & deployed large scale React & Redux
applications and turn any mistakes or successes into articles. Lately, I've been focusing
on consulting & teaching about all things React.

I love DnD, World of Warcraft, Fantasy Novels, etc. and sometimes it's all I can talk about.

# About me

I'm a Front end engineer & author. I was born and raised in Athens in 1991 - (pause for a
bit to do the math) -, where I attended the National Technical University of Athens as an
Electrical & Computer engineer.

My career as a software engineer officially started after my thesis got featured in a
major EU project. For the past 5 years I have been working primarily with Javascript &
Python.

Although I won't brand myself as a fullstack developer, I have worked over 2 years with
back-end & infrastructure technologies like Rails, Django, Memcached, Docker, Redis and
Elasticsearch and I keep creating services in Express & Flask for freelancing projects.
Since 2016, I have been working solely as a Front-end developer almost exclusively using
React & Svelte. I have successfully architected & deployed large scale React & Redux
applications

# Personal website

This is my personal website implemented using gatsby, emotion & react.
It contains all my articles and the work that I've done which I'm allowed
to publicly disclose.

It is deployed on Netlify, with the messaging
functionality implemented through Netlify serverless
functions (a.k.a. AWS lambdas)
